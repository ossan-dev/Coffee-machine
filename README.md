# Coffee-machine

## Fixes

1. expand this documentation by sharing with the user how to run the app, which options he might have, and so on
1. what do you mean with `type "report" at any moment`? It's not clear
1. when I need to insert coins, if I insert a not numeric value I should stay there
1. please switch the menu options by using the numbers. Try to think to real life. When you go to a coffee machine you don't have to type in the name of the desired beverage, a simple number is enough
1. when you type a wrong beverages (wrong number after the above-mentioned changes) you should stay in the menu, not exit the application
1. add the exit option as the last one in the menu
1. keep decreasing the amount of the due money as long as we insert coins
1. don't ask for dimes, nickles and pennies if we've already inserted enough money. You force the user to type three zeros that are useless
1. add a check on the number of coins inserted by the user. Otherwise the user can insert an endless number of coins
